    "*SUMMARY* : The goal of this test is to measure the general accuracy of the ClinAI agent strictly using voice. The test scenarios will be varied and simulate real patient convsersations/requests. The main features being tested here are: scheduling appointments, cancelling appointments, giving information about the clinic/office and refilling prescriptions. "

    "<small>*METHODOLOGY* : 42 scenarios have been created (Generated by AI to remove bias). I will use the microphone button for each prompt, meaning all input will be audio. Each scneario will be fed into the agent exactly as it is written in the \"Scenario\" column and the results of that conversation will be compared to the corresponding \"Expected Result\". If the results match, that scenario will recieve a \"PASS\". If the results don't match, that scenario will recieve a \"FAIL\". Images of the transcripts and updated information in the database will be provided in cells for full transparency.<small>"
